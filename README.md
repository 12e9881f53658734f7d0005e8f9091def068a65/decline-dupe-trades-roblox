# decline-dupe-trades-roblox
if you are lazy and let your trades pile up like i do then this is probably for you idk


if bot account send you trades and they spam you with it and you want to decline all trades from that user then thats what this does
if it finds that the user sent more than 1 trade then it will decline all trades that user sent
